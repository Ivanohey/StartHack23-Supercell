## Scopre of the project
This repository contains the prototype of an interface used by Supercell to identify cases of violation of conduct in their game. The backend of the application is using machine learning techniques to select players that could participate in the moderation program in exchange of in-game rewards.
We select the players based on several factors such as their play-time, age and risk-rank
